## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed

- **Project-specific token tracking**: Fixed bug where token display would swap between different projects' data when multiple VS Code windows are open
- **Exclude agent files**: Token tracking now correctly ignores agent subprocess JSONL files and only reads main session files
- **No global fallback**: When a workspace is open, only that project's tokens are shown (no cross-project contamination)

# Change Log

All notable changes to the "claude-usage-monitor" extension will be documented in this file.

## [2.6.4] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- **Token display now always visible**: "Tk" indicator stays in status bar at all times
  - Shows "Tk -" when no token data available (instead of disappearing)
  - Shows "Tk X%" when token data is present
  - Prevents status bar items from flickering in and out

## [2.6.3] - 2025-11-26

### Added

- **`claudeUsage.debug` setting**: Explicit debug mode control
  - Debug logging now only occurs when `claudeUsage.debug: true` OR running in F5 development mode
  - No resources wasted on debug output generation when not in debug mode
  - Lazy output channel creation - channels only created when debug mode is active

### Security

- **Fixed js-yaml prototype pollution vulnerability** (CVE) - Updated transitive dependency js-yaml 4.1.0 → 4.1.1

### Updated

- **Dependencies updated**: puppeteer 24.25.0 → 24.31.0, @types/vscode 1.105.0 → 1.106.1

## [2.6.2] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

  - Use "Claude: Show Debug Output" command to view debug information when needed
  - Provides cleaner experience for normal usage

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- **Status Bar Item Grouping**: Increased status bar priority to prevent other extensions from inserting items between Claude usage metrics
  - All Claude status bar items now stay grouped together (Claude label, session, weekly, sonnet, opus, credits, tokens)
  - Uses high base priority (1000) with consecutive decrements to maintain visual cohesion

## [2.6.0] - 2025-11-26

### Changed
- Improved error handling in data provider to gracefully degrade when web scraping encounters issues
- Status bar now intelligently shows available data even when one source fails

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-21

### Major Changes
- **BREAKING**: Removed complex activity-based refresh scheduling - now uses simple fixed 5-minute interval
- **NEW**: Session token tracking integration - displays both Claude.ai usage AND session token usage
- **NEW**: Usage level indicator now based on actual Claude usage, not keyboard edits
- **Simplified**: Default refresh interval is now 5 minutes for all usage checks

### Added
- Session token usage display in status bar (e.g., "Claude: 45% | Tokens: 26%")
- Reads `session-data.json` to show current development session token usage
- **New Activity Level Logic**: Shows "Claude time remaining" based on actual usage
  - Idle (0-24%): Plenty of Claude time remaining
  - Light (25-49%): Quarter of usage consumed
  - Moderate (50-79%): Halfway through available usage
  - Heavy (80-100%): Running low on Claude time!
  - Calculated from MAX of Claude.ai % or session token %
- Enhanced tooltip shows:
  - Claude.ai usage percentage and reset time
  - Session token usage (current/limit/percentage)
  - Session ID
  - Usage level with description

### Removed
- Activity-based dynamic refresh scheduling (was redundant and conceptually flawed)
- `activityBasedRefresh` configuration option
- Complex `scheduleNextRefresh()` and `checkAndRescheduleIfNeeded()` logic
- VS Code edit tracking (text document changes, file saves, editor switches)
- Edit count and file change count metrics

### Changed
- Default `autoRefreshMinutes` changed from 15 to 5
- Refresh interval is now fixed (not dynamic based on activity)
- Status bar updates include session data from `session-data.json`

### Technical Changes
- Integrated `SessionTracker` class for reading session data
- Updated `updateStatusBar()` to accept optional `sessionData` parameter
- New `updateStatusBarWithAllData()` helper consolidates all status bar updates
- Removed `activityCheckTimer` (no longer needed)
- **Rewrote `ActivityMonitor` class**: Now stateless, calculates from usage data on-demand
- `getStats()` now accepts `usageData` and `sessionData` parameters
- Activity level based on `Math.max(claudePercent, tokenPercent)` with thresholds: 25%, 50%, 80%
- Removed all VS Code event listeners (no longer tracking edits)

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- Fixed `waitForTimeout is not a function` error with Puppeteer v24
- Replaced deprecated `page.waitForTimeout()` with Promise-based `sleep()` helper
- Improved compatibility with latest Puppeteer API

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-20

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Smart Activity-Based Refresh** 🚀: Extension now monitors VS Code activity and adjusts refresh intervals dynamically
  - Heavy coding (100+ edits/15min): 5-minute refresh
  - Moderate activity (30-100 edits/15min): 15-minute refresh
  - Light activity (1-30 edits/15min): 30-minute refresh
  - Idle (no activity): 60-minute refresh
- **Activity Level Tooltip**: Status bar hover now displays current activity level and next refresh interval

- Activity monitoring module (`activityMonitor.js`) tracks text edits, file saves, and editor changes
- Console logging of activity levels and next refresh time for debugging
- Smart session detection checks for existing cookies before launching browser
- Activity level checked on startup to set initial refresh interval

### Changed
- **Auto-Start Enabled by Default**: `claudeUsage.fetchOnStartup` now defaults to `true` - usage fetches automatically on VS Code startup
- **Headless Mode Enabled by Default**: `claudeUsage.headless` now defaults to `true` - browser runs hidden after initial login
- **Smart Headless Detection**: Browser automatically shows if login is needed (no session found), runs hidden otherwise
- Direct navigation to `https://claude.ai/settings/usage` in both `ensureLoggedIn()` and `fetchUsageData()` (skips homepage redirect)
- Removed unnecessary tab clicking and intermediate navigation logic from scraper
- Updated default `autoRefreshMinutes` from `0` to `15` (used only when activity-based refresh is disabled)
- Configuration descriptions updated to reflect new smart defaults

### Improved
- Faster initial load: eliminates redirect through `claude.ai/new` page
- Better performance: reduced navigation steps from 2+ to 1
- Smarter refresh scheduling based on actual coding activity
- More efficient session handling with cookie-based detection
- No browser window shown unless login is actually required

### Fixed
- Extension now works correctly with F5 debugging (removed unnecessary `preLaunchTask` from launch.json)

### Planned Features
- Usage history tracking and graphing
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Multiple account support
- Export usage data to CSV
- Desktop notifications when approaching limits
- Dark/light theme-aware icons
